<h3> About me </h3>
</head>
<p>
    I was born in Penticton, BC. We lived in Penticton for 15 years the moved to Kelowna. My Family and I moved to
    Kelowna so my sister and I could attend Post secondary education there.
    I was doing my undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus but I did not
    enjoy it. I also believe I had become burntout which made me enjoy it even less.
    I decided to come to BCIT as this institution has a great reputatation for students being placed in the workfield.
    I am <strong><em>very</em></strong> excited to be in this program and am very excited to learn programming.
