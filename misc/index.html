            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>
                I was born in <strong><em>Penticton</em></strong>, BC. We lived in <strong><em>Penticton</em></strong>
                for
                15 years the moved to Kelowna. My Family and I moved to
                Kelowna so my sister and I could attend Post secondary education there.
                I was doing my undergraduate degree in Biology at the University of British Columbia Okanagan Campus but
                I did not enjoy it. I also believe I had become burntout which made me enjoy it even less.
                I decided to come to BCIT as this institution has a great reputatation for students being placed in the
                workfield.
                I am <strong><em>very</em></strong> excited to be in this program and am very excited to learn
                programming.
